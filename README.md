# Huffinton Post API for R

Relatively simple connection to Huffpo's API
   
## What works now

- Requests for charts or polls (both a user friendly version and a simpler, more dangerous version)
- Some xPath helper functions like building expressions including conditionals
- State polls can be downloaded and parsed into dataframes with the appropriate matching of responses to questions, pollsters, polls and topics. 

## What may work in the future

- Grab individual chart topics
- concatenate multiple states/topics
- Graphs!

## What you can do

- Send me nasty emails.
- Or pull requests
