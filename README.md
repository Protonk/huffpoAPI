# Huffinton Post API for R

Relatively simple connection to Huffpo's API

## Some advantages over doing it in the browser

- You can be lazy
    - specfy a state as the abbrevation or something close to the state name.
    - specify a topic w/ a short name like "house" or the proper name like 2012-house
   
## What works now

- Basically only a GET request for charts or polls. That works fine, tho

## What may work in the future

- Grab individual chart topics
- concatenate multiple states/topics
- other XML-ish stuff on the other side
- Graphs!

## What you can do

- Send me nasty emails.
- Or pull requests
